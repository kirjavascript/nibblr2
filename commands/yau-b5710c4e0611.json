Yau is not a solving method unto itself, but rather another rediscovery of a fully functioning hybrid system made popular by Seb Weyer, direct solving and reduction comprising a full method as defined by Erik Akkersdijk.\nMany 4x4x4 users run a modified version of the k4dux system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of k4dux which is widely used today is often called \"Yau\", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the k4dux, developed by Thom Barlow and Erik Akkersdijk.`)"
